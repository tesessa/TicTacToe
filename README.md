# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game
You can play one player or 2 player
If you play one player you can either do easy, medium or hard difficulty
Easy difficulty the CPU will just pick a random empty spot in the array and fill it (it won't actually really play)
Medium and Hard both have blocking, where they will block you from winning in some cases
Hard will try to win if it gets 2 in a row
